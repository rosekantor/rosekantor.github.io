Ongoing [NSF-CBET](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1804118) focused on understanding potential impacts of highly treated water on the microbial communities in drinking water distribution systems.

Microbiomes of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse
------
Analysis of microbiomes from pilot advanced treatment trains using metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The first publication from this work appears [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00993/full). Partially funded as part of the [ReNUWIt NSF-ERC](https://renuwit.org/).
