I am a microbial ecologist working with water engineers to understand the effects of advanced treatment and distribution on the drinking water microbiome.  I am interested in the broader application of high-throughput DNA sequencing analyses and big data in the water industry.  I want to help water professionals navigate these new tools for drinking water microbiology.

I value reproducibility, teamwork, and community in research. I enjoy consulting, collaborating with stakeholders, mentoring, and teaching.

Current
------
Postdoctoral researcher in the lab of [Prof. Kara Nelson](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/nelson), University of California, Berkeley

Education
------
**Ph.D.** in Microbiology (Banfield Lab), University of California, Berkeley (2016)  
**B.A.** in Biology, Carleton College (2010)


Experience
------
I have 8 years of experience working with high-throughput DNA sequencing data, including genome-resolved metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.  My background in microbiology spans mining wastewater treatment research, discovery of novel CRISPR-Cas for industry, and advanced treatment of drinking water for potable reuse.  I have worked in utility and consulting joint projects, international academic collaborations, and an early-stage biotech startup.
